				<p>
					This picture was taken in a field near Eiksmarka. It was at the start of
					Elias and their friends' first ever move. But one of the flatmembers'
					family was on vacation and could not drive her things to the flat, and this
					picture is documenting the moving process which consisted of walking and
					public transport. The people photographed are Mathilde and Ingerid.
